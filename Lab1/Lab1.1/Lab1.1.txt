1. What criteria should be used in choosing an appropriate requirements engineering tool?

2. Are there any drawbacks to using certain tools in requirements engineering activities?

3. When selecting an open-source tool, what characteristics should you look for?

4. How can tools enable distributed, global requirements engineering activities? What are the drawbacks in this regard?

5. If an environment does not currently engage in solid requirements engineering practices, should tools be introduced?

6. What sort of problems might you find through a traceability matrix that you might not see without one?

7. How is AI being proposed for knowledge acquisition and representation in requirements specifications?

Answers:

5. 
- Tools can be useful for improving requirements engineering practices, but they are not a substitute for a well-defined process, skilled engineers, and effective communication.
- Tools should be introduced only after a careful evaluation of their suitability, usability, compatibility, and scalability for the specific environment and project needs.

6. 
- Missing requirements: Some requirements may not be traced to any source or stakeholder, indicating that they are not justified or validated.
- Inconsistent requirements: Some requirements may be traced to conflicting sources or stakeholders, indicating that they are not agreed upon or reconciled.
- Unsatisfied requirements: Some requirements may not be traced to any design element, test case, or implementation component, indicating that they are not fulfilled or verified.
- Unnecessary elements: Some design elements, test cases, or implementation components may not be traced to any requirement, indicating that they are redundant or irrelevant.

7. 
- Natural language processing (NLP): AI can be used to analyze natural language texts, such as stakeholder interviews, documents, or online sources, and extract relevant information, concepts, and relationships for requirements engineering. NLP can also be used to generate natural language specifications from formal models or vice versa.
- Ontologies and semantic web: AI can be used to create and manage ontologies, which are formal representations of the concepts and relationships in a domain. Ontologies can help to structure, organize, and share knowledge for requirements engineering. Semantic web technologies can also enable interoperability and integration of heterogeneous data sources and systems.
- Machine learning (ML): AI can be used to learn from data and discover patterns, trends, anomalies, or preferences for requirements engineering. ML can also be used to classify, cluster, or rank requirements based on various criteria or metrics. ML can also support requirements validation, verification, and testing by generating test cases, scenarios, or oracles.
- Knowledge-based systems (KBS): AI can be used to create and use knowledge bases, which are collections of facts and rules that represent domain knowledge. KBS can provide reasoning and inference capabilities for requirements engineering, such as checking consistency, completeness, or correctness of requirements, or suggesting improvements or alternatives. KBS can also support decision making and negotiation among stakeholders.
